# communityportal
This repository is for creating a community platform for all members of GirlScript Foundation. 
GirlScript is a section-8 not for profit company registered under Governement of India.
We welcome new ideas for the portal. Although the platform must include the following-
a) A login page for community members, leaders and admins.
b) Dashboard for everyone's profile with their basic info and ratings given by admins.
c) Admins are the core team members of the foundation and will rate the profiles on the basis of contributions.
d) Leaders will automatically be eligible for giving ratings to other members after getting a 3 star profile our of 5.
e) A form for submitting new details of an upcoming event by local chapter, submitting the videos, photos, feedback and statistics
in the same form upon completion and also for submitting the swag request and proposed statistics.
f) A list of all upcoming and past events and a button to RSVP for upcoming events and writing feedbacks for event attended.
g) A leaderboard to see which leader has made the most contributions and can be promoted to higher role of responsibility.

All ideas on tech stack are welcome. Also, we are accepting applications for the role of project moderator.
Please share all ideas/feedback/applications on community@girlscript.tech
